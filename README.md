# Stock Price Prediction using Python 

## Objective:
**Used Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to extract and analyze the information, 
visualize it, and look at different ways to analyze the risk of a stock, based on its performance history.**

## Tools & Libraries
- **Tools:** Python & Jupyter notebook
- **Libraries:** yfinance, pandas & matplotlib

## Problem Statement
1. Read the Data from Yahoo finance website directly.
2. Perform cleaning.
3. What was the change in stock price over time?
4. Visualize the change in a stock’s volume being traded, over time?
5. What was the moving average of various stocks?
6. What was the daily return average of a stock?
7. Add a new column ‘Trend’ whose values are based on the 'Daily Return'.
8. Visualize trend frequency through a Pie Chart.
9. What was the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks?

## Process:
1. Data Collection from Yahoo Finance
2. EDA & Cleaning
3. Visualization
4. Evaluation
5. Correlation between different stocks

## Key Features
- Real-time data fetch using yfinance
- Rolling statistics, ARIMA, and LSTM models
- Plots to compare actual vs. predicted prices
- Predict the future stock prices using both statistical and deep learning models.

## Outcome:
**The final outcome is complete analysis and visualization of stock trends, risk through daily returns and correlations between all the stocks like 
Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. This will help us to understand market behavior and investment insights.**
